# weather-app

This is my weather app, I have started it and will update daily. 
After 2 days of working on it, I am finally uploading the files on the github for viewer to help me on my mistakes
still needs a lot of changes and I am working on it


Today, I have made a lot of changes and now it is almost to complete my weather website, it still have some glitches but I am 
sure I can remove that glitches too.
